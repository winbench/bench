## Description
Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device.

World-class code editing, debugging, performance tooling, a flexible build system, and an instant build/deploy system all allow you to focus on building unique and high quality apps.

**HINT:** At the first run of Android Studio, you need to point it to the
Android SDK root directory in `%BENCH_HOME%\lib\apps\bench\android-sdk`.
Otherwise it will download and set up an additional Android SDK in the Windows user profile.
