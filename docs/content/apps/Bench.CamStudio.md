## Description
CamStudio is a great tool to create quick demos and screencasts on your computer
in AVI and, if you wish, you can convert them into Flash format.

CamStudio's features include options to highlight the cursor path during a
recording session, automatic panning, and the ability to record with sound.

An effects menu lets you annotate and append videos with comments,
plus add a time stamp or watermark. CamStudio also captures screenshots
if you set the frame rate, drag the mouse over the area for capture,
and tap on the coordinates.
