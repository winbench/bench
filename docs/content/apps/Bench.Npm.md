## Description
npm is the package manager for JavaScript.
Find, share, and reuse packages of code from hundreds of thousands of
developers — and assemble them in powerful new ways.

Because _Node.js_ is downloaded as bare executable, _NPM_ must be installed seperately.
But NPM, in its latest versions, is only distributed as part of the _Node.js_ setup.
_NPM_ 1.4.12 is the last version of _NPM_ which was released seperately.
Therefore, the latest version of _NPM_ is installed afterwards via the setup script `auto\apps\npm.setup.ps1`.
