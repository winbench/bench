## Description
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

It contains among other things:

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.


The pre-comiled version of this package comes from
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>.
Thanks a lot to Christoph Golke for his service.
