## Description
_This app switches automatically to Tftpd64 if the environment supports 64 Bit programs._

Tftpd32 is a free, opensource IPv6 ready application which includes
DHCP, TFTP, DNS, SNTP and Syslog servers as well as a TFTP client.
The TFTP client and server are fully compatible with TFTP option support
(tsize, blocksize and timeout), which allow the maximum performance
when transferring the data.

Some extended features such as directory facility, security tuning, interface filtering;
progress bars and early acknowledgments enhance usefulness and throughput of the TFTP protocol
for both client and server.

The included DHCP server provides unlimited automatic or static IP address assignment.
