## Description
Docker provides a way to run applications securely isolated in a container,
packaged with all its dependencies and libraries.

**Warning:** This app does not install Virtual Box, as the Docker Toolbox Installer would.
To find this app useful, you probably have to manually install 
[Hyper-V](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/hyper-v/),
[VirtualBox](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/virtualbox/),
or [VmWare Workstation](https://github.com/pecigonzalo/docker-machine-vmwareworkstation) on your PC.
For usage with VmWare Workstation activate the app _Docker Machine VmWare Workstation Driver_.
