## Description
From mobile apps to microservices, from small startups to big enterprises, Gradle helps teams build, automate and deliver better software, faster. 

**WARNING:**
Gradle is writing to the `.gradle` folder in the Windows user profile directory and the setup creates a `gradle.properties` file for the proxy configuration if not already present.
