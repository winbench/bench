## Description
Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language,
adding features that allow variables, mixins, funtions and many other techniques
that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable.

Less runs inside Node, the browser and inside Rhino.
There are also many 3rd party tools that allow you to compile your files and watch for changes.


The shell command of Less is `lessc`.
