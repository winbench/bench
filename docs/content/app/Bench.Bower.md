## Description
Web sites are made of lots of things — frameworks, libraries, assets, and utilities.
Bower manages all these things for you.

Bower can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files.
Bower doesn’t concatenate or minify code or do anything else - it just installs
the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies.
