When Bench is installed and the [Bench Dashboard][] is poped up,
it is time to select and install the apps you want to use.
Open the [Setup Window][], if not allready open,
and take a look into the [App List][].
There are single apps and app groups listed.

To activate an app or a group, just check the box in the column _Active_.
You can observe, that some boxes are in _the third state_,
meaning, they are neither checked nor not checked.
These apps are activated implicitly as a dependency of Bench
or another activated app.

To start the download and installation of all activated apps,
just click on the [Auto Setup Button][] ![Auto Setup Button](/img/do_16.png)
in the top on the right side.
After the setup process has finished, you can close the setup window.

You can find a more detailed description of the app management in the tutorials
[Selecting and Installing Apps](/tutorial/apps)
and [Defining Custom Apps](/tutorial/apps-custom).
