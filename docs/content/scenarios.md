Bench aims to take the pain out of the following scenarios:

* I quickly need a command line tool under Windows but first I need to
  find it on the web, then download it, install it, and then make shure
  it is on the `PATH` variable, but wait it has a dependency I need to
  fulfill first...
<!--more-->
* I have a project with a number of tool dependencies and want a friend
  to help me make progress, but then he needs to install all the tools
  I so carefully prepared on my maschine...
* I want to try out another programming language, but I don't want to spent
  my time preparing all the tools I need, but instead invest it in learning
  the new language...
* I am behind a proxy firewall and I need to configure my _Eclipse_, _Git_,
  _JDK_ (which never updates `JAVA_HOME` on updates), _Maven_ and _GnuPG_
  to work with public repositories...
* I am switching development machines on a regular bases, and I need
  to keep the tools and the configuration of the command-line environment
  in sync, between all of them...
* I have a PHP project which uses _PostgreSQL_ and I need it portable on a
  USB flash drive, but XAMPP or whatever packages out there always feature
  _MySQL_...
