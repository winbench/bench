_Bench_ is a portable environment for software development on Windows.

The recurring pain to install and configure numerous command-line tools
and other programs under Windows with all its pit falls and side-effects
led to the development of _Bench_.
It evolved from a collection of some PowerShell scripts, into a .NET library
and a GUI for quick and easy configuration of a development environment.
It aims to feel comfortable from the command-lines perspective but
at the same time to be easy to use via a graphical interface.

Bench is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mastersign/bench/)
and is mainly developed by [Tobias Kiertscher](http://www.mastersign.de/).
